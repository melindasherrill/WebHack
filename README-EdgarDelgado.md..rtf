\f0\fs24 \cf0 I wrote the TcpSynAttack.java file which sends DoSS attacks to the website. The file does the attack by using TCP/socket programming. It creates a socket connection to the server(to the website) and sends multiple packets to it until the website crashes. I convert many variables into bytes and I use the ByteBuffer class to create an array of all the bytes. Then I send the array of type byte as packet to server(website). I also run googles check style to meet googles coding standard. \
