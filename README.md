# Web Exploiting Project
## CPSC 353

> Let's face it, websites are vulnerable, and in a growing world of technical advancement, they are only getting weaker. Cyber and security techniques in preventing attacks are becoming futile than ever. This project details examples the average hacker would use when trying to exploit a website. Our goal is to enlighten the novice web-developer and technologically illiterate on possible threats that exist within the hacking realm.

> The website we are hacking is frechetta.me . The python scripts interface with this website to exploit sql commands. Try messing around with the login page. Try typing in the login inputs:
``` 
OR '1'='1' /*
```
